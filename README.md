Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that deals in the financial plans of their many customers. The client wished to modernize their system and wanted to use the most current and most secure security for their system. By using a RESTful web application, they wanted my team and me to identify any vulnerabilities.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

After finding the client's software security vulnerabilities the thing i did well was then identify the fixes that could be applied, by using the dependency report. The reason it is i portant to code securely is because for this company for example, peoples personal information is being used to allow access to their financial accounts, and not making sure to code securely can cause these peoples names, address, and other key information to be taken by unauthorized threats putting them at risk. This is the reason why it is important to software securely, for it also imporves the company's wellbeing, allowing them to be more trustworthy, as well as allows them to also secure their information as well.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part of vulnerability assessment that was challenging for me was the checksum verification. Getting the cyphered text to then be accessed over my localhost was difficult for me to get to run properly.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

The way I increased layers of security was to use the algorithm SHA-256 as well as create a certificate that had a password key that needed to be used to verify the website. Using the dependency report is what I would use to verify the vulnerabilities and in which help guide me in which mitigation techniques to use to mitigate these vulnerabilites.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

By following proper coding guidelines I can make certain that my code is functional, and by using the dependency report as well as making sure to secure the application by going through the vulnerability assessment process flow, I can make sure the software is secure. After refactoring code, by running the code and checking the dependency report I can then check for any new vulnerabilities that have been created in the refactored code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The use of maven and the dependency report was a resources I feel will come in handy in furture assignments and tasks. Also understanding on algothims will help with any future assignments or tasks.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

My ability to find the areas of security as well as my manual review, which can be found it my vulnerablility report assessment report.
